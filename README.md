# Object-Localization-using-TensorFlow

 In this project, we are working with the assumption that there is just one object in any given image, and our CNN model will classify and localize that object.
 
 **"epochs" and "steps_per_epoch" can be increased to get more precise output**
 
 Coded in Google Colaboratory
